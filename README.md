# weather-app
Weather simple dashboard using data from (http://openweathermap.org) using Angular 2
![Weather Application Dashboard](/src/assets/images/weather-app.png?raw=true)
## Install
You should have angular-cli to deal with this. install via
`npm install -g angular-cli`
Then, you can install the app itself by
`npm install`
## Play
You can by a hit of a command see the application running, just
`npm start`
And the world will be at your hands.
## Notes
1. Because of limited time, application assumes you will run it on default angular-cli port http://localhost:4200
2. Unfortunately, also because of time, Weather API ID is hard coded within the application.
